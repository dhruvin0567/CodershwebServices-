        "Shopify and Shopify Plus offer a powerful, integrated solution for B2B and wholesale businesses, streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency. By consolidating inventory, orders, and customer data in one location, Shopify makes it easy to manage retail and wholesale clients alongside your direct-to-consumer (DTC) customers. B2B features like custom pricing, volume-based discounts, and tailored customer experiences allow businesses to operate from a single platform while offering flexible billing options, including pricing in multiple currencies and custom price lists.",
      text2:
        "Shopify’s wholesale functionality includes a dedicated order center, enabling clients to place orders at their convenience, eliminating manual order forms and lengthy processes. This feature is particularly valuable for businesses expanding globally or serving diverse markets, making wholesale orders as seamless as DTC transactions.

                    As businesses expand globally on Shopify, adapting to
                    international markets is crucial. Going global enables
                    merchants to access a broader customer base, increase
                    transactions, and boost revenue. Recent data shows that 35%
                    of Shopify traffic is international, emphasizing the need
                    for a global ecommerce strategy. Additionally, 92% of these
                    visitors prefer shopping in their local currency, with 33%
                    likely to abandon purchases if prices are only in US
                    dollars.
